## Initial Request
Brainstorm and plan the GUI side of the training pipeline with focus on:

- Live adjustment of dt and other parameters
- Side-loading model policies live
- Train button in trust-strip as gateway to training menu
- Training menu fills 3/4 of screen (minimizable to ribbon)
- Check on training programs of different robots
- Round-robin interface with D-pad navigation (Steam Deck optimized)
- Interactive floating robot URDF models in training view
- Live preview on hover showing most recent training video
- REAL-SIM <-> SIM-REAL pipeline workflow

## Final Request
Replace (EP 0) counter with (AD #) for anomaly detection and (AR #) for anomaly reset counter in the teleop sim subpanel.

## Key Solutions
- Designed Training Panel with carousel-based session management
- Created `docs/plans/2026-02-04-training-panel-design.md` with full UI specification
- Created `docs/plans/2026-02-04-training-panel-implementation.md` with phased implementation plan
- Implemented session carousel with D-pad navigation (`SessionCarousel.jsx`)
- Created session cards showing robot, session type, and checkpoint (`SessionCard.jsx`)
- Added 3D URDF preview component for robot visualization (`URDFPreview.jsx`)
- Created URDF registry config: `configs/urdf_registry.json`
- Added "Hot Row" of 6 always-visible training knobs (policy rate, command range, reward mix, etc.)
- Designed PiP (Picture-in-Picture) for training video preview
- Phase-based UI: Teleop Recording -> Training -> Eval/Blend
- Button mappings optimized for Steam Deck (D-pad, A/B/X/Y, triggers)
- Fixed Training Panel to not hide the Train button
- Added 50px margin above/below panel to avoid overlap with other UI elements
- Replaced EP counter with AD (anomaly detection) and AR (anomaly reset) counters in `SimTelemetryPane.jsx`
- Modified `bridge_server.py` to provide anomaly detection/reset metrics
